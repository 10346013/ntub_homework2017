There are three structures in Ruby ï¼š Model,View,Controller
Each one have a clear file name and object name,so users can find it in every project easily.

Controller is stored in app/controllers;Model is stored in app/models
  Actions are all in Controller.If you want to start an action,you can tell Model what you want to do 
then Model will convert our language to SQL to get data that we need.Throw the pack of datas to Controller/Action.
View is also interface in order to prettify the undressed data, present the better interface to users.Lsat, integrate
Controller/Action and View is what we see on the website.
